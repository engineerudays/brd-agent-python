# Outputs Directory

This directory contains the outputs generated by the Planning Agent and Design Agent workflows.

## Structure

```
outputs/
├── engineering_plans/         # Generated engineering plans
├── project_schedules/         # Generated project schedules
├── architecture_docs/         # Generated architecture documents (from Design Agent)
├── poc_documents/            # Generated PoC documents (from Design Agent)
└── tech_stack_recommendations/ # Generated tech stack recommendations (from Design Agent)
```

## File Naming Convention

All output files follow this naming pattern:

```
{output_type}_{brd_name}_{version}_{timestamp}.json
```

**Examples:**
- `engineering_plan_customer_onboarding_portal_v1_2025-11-15_10-30-45.json`
- `project_schedule_ecommerce_platform_v2_2025-11-15_11-20-30.json`
- `architecture_customer_portal_v1_2025-11-15_12-00-00.json`

## Versioning

- **v1**: First generation
- **v2, v3, etc.**: Subsequent regenerations of the same BRD
- Versioning is automatic based on existing files

## Usage

These files are:
- ✅ Automatically generated by n8n workflows
- ✅ Timestamped for easy tracking
- ✅ Named after the source BRD for traceability
- ✅ Versioned to prevent overwrites

## Gitignore

By default, output files are **included in git** so you can track your generated artifacts. If you want to exclude them, add to `.gitignore`:

```
sample_inputs/outputs/**/*.json
!sample_inputs/outputs/README.md
```

## Cleanup

To remove old outputs and keep only the latest versions:

```bash
# Keep only the latest version of each BRD output
cd sample_inputs/outputs
find . -name "*.json" -type f | sort -r | awk -F'_v' '{print $1}' | uniq -d | xargs rm -f
```

---

**Note:** These outputs are generated artifacts and can be regenerated anytime from the original BRDs.
